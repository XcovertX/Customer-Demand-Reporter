# Customer-Demand-Reporter

This is a small program I designed to track new customer demand for storage units. The program tracks what form of contact the potential customers contacted us through, what day they contacted us, their personal information if provided and the type of storage unit they were inquiring about. All employees have access to the program and can input under their specific user ID. Managers can build end-of-the-month reports for presentation.

The application uploads the files to a cloud filing system so all employees can review in real time.

# Future
I am considering building a bot that to retrieve competitor information, such as pricing and availability, to incorporate a real time price modifying algorithm. The algorithm would suggest discounts or price increases based on local market availability.
